It's time-consuming in itself, and it steals a load of cognitive capacity from your budget.\n\nAnd it prevents you from being agile and flexible.\n\nThe good thing is, the cure is pretty simple:\nStart saying no to things that need to happen at a specific time or place.\n\nMeetings?

Try to avoid them.\n\nExecute your tasks and communicate in an async manner.\nIt's totally possible to arrange. I built my team around this core principle.\n\nAnd now your calendar is free for important things.\nFamily time. Going out. Catching up with old friends. Participating in fun events.

This has made it very easy to keep the designs consistent and make minor tweaks to achieve the results you're looking for\n\nOne of the coolest things is that every site is completely bespoke and unique.

I've spent countless hours tinkering and experimenting with different tools, and I must say, the results are getting better with each iteration.\n\nAI is transforming industries across the board, but it's especially thrilling to see its impact on the field of web design. From automating repetitive tasks to generating creative and unique designs, AI is revolutionizing the way we approach web design.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on this exciting new development.
